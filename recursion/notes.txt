Recursion
---------
What is Recursion? 
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. 
Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. 
Eg : Towers of Hanoi (TOH), Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals, DFS of Graph, etc.


What is base condition in recursion? 
In the recursive program, the solution to the base case is provided and the solution of the bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems


Why Stack Overflow error occurs in recursion? 
If the base case is not reached or not defined, then the stack overflow problem may arise


Memory allocation of Recursive method
Each recursive call creates a new copy of that method in the memory. Once some data is returned by the method, the copy is removed from the memory.
 Since all the variables and other stuff declared inside function get stored in the stack, therefore a separate stack is maintained at each recursive call.
 Once the value is returned from the corresponding function, the stack gets destroyed. 


What are the disadvantages of recursive programming over iterative programming? 
It takes a lot of stack space compared to an iterative program.
It uses more processor time.
It can be more difficult to debug compared to an equivalent iterative program


What are the advantages of recursive programming over iterative programming? 
Recursion provides a clean and simple way to write code.
Recursion is required in problems concerning data structures and advanced algorithms, such as Graph and Tree Traversal.

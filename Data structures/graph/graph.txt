GRAPH
-----
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.


Graph Terminology
    - Adjacency: A vertex is said to be adjacent to another vertex if there is an edge connecting them. Vertices 2 and 3 are not adjacent because there is no edge between them.
    - Path: A sequence of edges that allows you to go from vertex A to vertex B is called a path. 0-1, 1-2 and 0-2 are paths from vertex 0 to vertex 2.
    - Directed Graph: A graph in which an edge (u,v) doesn't necessarily mean that there is an edge (v, u) as well. The edges in such a graph are represented by arrows to show the direction of the edge.

Graph Representation
    1. Adjacency Matrix
        An adjacency matrix is a 2D array of V x V vertices. Each row and column represent a vertex.
        If the value of any element a[i][j] is 1, it represents that there is an edge connecting vertex i and vertex j.
    2. Adjacency List
        An adjacency list represents a graph as an array of linked lists.
        The index of the array represents a vertex and each element in its linked list represents the other vertices that form an edge with the vertex.

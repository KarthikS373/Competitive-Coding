new and delete operators in C++ for dynamic memory
--------------------------------------------------
Dynamically allocated memory is allocated on Heap and non-static and local variables get memory allocated on Stack


Stack: 
The stack memory is a physical space (in RAM) allocated to each thread at run time. It is created when a thread creates.
It stores the variables, references to objects, and partial results.
The scope of the elements is limited to their threads

Heap:
It dynamically handles the memory blocks. It means, we need not to handle the memory manually.
Memory allocated to heap lives until any one event, either program terminated or memory free does not occur. The elements are globally accessible in the application.

new operator
------------
The new operator denotes a request for memory allocation on the Free Store.
If sufficient memory is available, new operator initializes the memory and returns the address of the newly allocated and initialized memory to the pointer variable. 
syntax :
    pointer-variable = new data-type;
    pointer-variable = new data-type[size];




delete operator 
---------------
delete operator is used to to deallocate dynamically allocated memory
syntax :
    delete pointer-variable;  
    delete[] pointer-variable;
